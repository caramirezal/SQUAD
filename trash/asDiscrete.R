## asDiscrete transforms continuous interpolations of BRN models back to Boolean models.
asDiscrete <- function() {
        ## define a vector of length 2**k. Where k is the number of regulators of a node
        ## loop over this vector. Assign every entry the following function.
        ## Let i be the index of the entry. Then map i to its boolean representation.
        ## lastly, evaluate this vector with the continuous interpolation.
        ## Define a list with regulators, the boolean vector function, and the 
        ## continuous approximation string expressions
        ## Loop over every node.
