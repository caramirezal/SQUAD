# SQUAD
Standardized Qualitative Analysis of Dynamical Systems 

The aim of the proyect is to implement the updated version of the Standardized Qualitative Analysis of Dynamical Systems (SQUAD) method described in Martínez-Sosa in 2013 (1), as modified from the first version in Di Cara, 2007 (2). The project is writen in R language.

## Dependencies

Prior to use the SQUAD R package please install the following packages:

* deSolve
* BoolNet
* reshape2

See the documentation of the project [here](https://caramirezal.github.io/squadTutorial/index.html).
